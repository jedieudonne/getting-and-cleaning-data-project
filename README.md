# getting-and-cleaning-data-project

this is the run analysis programming assignement. 
the program is divided in 12 parts :

# 1st part : getting data
connect to the url, download the files. 

Note :  this part can be omitted because the text of the assignement says "code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory".
I think this part is usefull, so I let it in my final submission.

# 2nd part : reading data
reads every file necessary to the programm.

# 3rd part : subsetting "features"
selects the features with mean and std.

# 4th part 1 : subsetting "train"

# 5th part 2 : subsetting "test"

# 6th part : merging and naming

In this course I read many things on internet. Special thanks to rdpeng, Dheeraj Agarwal, Gregory D. Horne, benjamin-chan, glynn, sdrdis, and many others. Their point of view on the assignement helped me to construct my own submission.
