# getting-and-cleaning-data-project

this is the run analysis programming assignement. 
the program is divided in 10 parts :

# 1st part : getting data
connect to the url, download the files. 

Note :  this part can be omitted because the text of the assignement says "code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory".
I think this part is usefull, so I let it in my final submission.

# 2nd part : subsetting "features"
selects the features with mean and std.

# 3rd part 1 : subsetting "train"
reads train and subset following the features 

# 3rd part 2 : subsetting "test"
reads test and subset following the features 

# 4th part : merging and naming
concatenate train and test, and gives names to the columns.

# 5th part : reading all about activities  
reads about activities.                        

# 6th part : creating final.activity
concatenate activity files.

# 7th part : reading all about subjects
reads about activities.

# 8th part : creating final.subjects
concatenate activity files.

# 9th part : grouping

# 10th part : creating final file

In this course I read many things on internet. Special thanks to rdpeng, benjamin-chan, glynn, sdrdis, and many others. Their point of view on the assignement helped me to construct my own submission.
